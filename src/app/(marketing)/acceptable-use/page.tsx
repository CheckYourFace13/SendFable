        Acceptable Use &amp; Anti-Spam Policy
      </h1>
      <p>Last updated: July 24, 2026</p>
      <p>
        This policy is part of the Sendfable{" "}
        <a className="underline" href="/terms">
          Terms of Service
        </a>
        . Sendfable exists to help small businesses send email people actually asked for. Sending
        unsolicited email hurts every customer on the platform, so we enforce this policy strictly.
      </p>

      <h2 className="pt-4 text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Permission is required</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Every contact you import, collect, or message must have given you affirmative, verifiable
          consent to receive email from your business.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Purchased, rented, scraped, harvested, appended, or co-registered lists are
          prohibited.</strong> Using one is grounds for immediate suspension or termination without
          refund.
        </li>
        <li>
          You are responsible for the lawfulness of your lists and content under the laws that
          apply to you (for example CAN-SPAM, CASL, GDPR/ePrivacy).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="pt-4 text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Required in every campaign</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A working unsubscribe link (we add one-click unsubscribe, RFC 8058, automatically).</li>
        <li>Your valid physical mailing address in the footer (enforced before first send).</li>
        <li>Accurate sender identity — no misleading from-names, subjects, or headers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="pt-4 text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Unsubscribes, bounces, and complaints</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Unsubscribe requests take effect immediately and are honored on every future send.</li>
        <li>Hard bounces and spam complaints are suppressed automatically and platform-wide.</li>
        <li>
          Sustained bounce rates above 5% or complaint rates above 0.1% can automatically pause
          campaigns and trigger an account review.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="pt-4 text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Prohibited content and behavior</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Phishing, malware, deceptive practices, or impersonation.</li>
        <li>Illegal products or services, or content that is unlawful where you or your recipients are located.</li>
        <li>Deliberately evading suppression lists, sending limits, or abuse controls (including re-importing unsubscribed contacts).</li>
        <li>Sharing an account to send on behalf of unrelated third parties.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="pt-4 text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Enforcement</h2>
      <p>
        We may throttle, pause, suspend, review, or terminate accounts that violate this policy or
        that harm platform deliverability, with or without notice depending on severity. We may
        retain suppression records after account closure to protect recipients.
      </p>

      <h2 className="pt-4 text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900">Reporting abuse</h2>
      <p>
        If you received unwanted email sent through Sendfable, report it to{" "}
        <a className="underline" href="mailto:abuse@sendfable.com">
